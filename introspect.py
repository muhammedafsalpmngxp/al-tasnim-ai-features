"""Build a compact, LLM-friendly schema description from the live database.

Only the schemas listed in ALLOWED_SCHEMAS are included. Application/BI tables

The description includes, per table: columns (+ PK markers) and declared foreign keys only.
An earlier version also guessed "JOINABLE" relationships from columns sharing a name with another
table's primary key. Removed: a name match is not proof of a real relationship — two unrelated
columns can happen to share a name — and a wrong guess here is invisible to review, unlike a
business rule in domain/business_rules.md, which a person actually reads and can correct.
